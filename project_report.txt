PROJECT REPORT: Web Store
==========================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
This project is a modern e-commerce web application built with React and Vite. It is designed to interface with Shopify's Storefront API to handle product browsing, cart management, and customer authentication.

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
-------------------
- Core Framework: React 19
- Build Tool: Vite
- Routing: React Router DOM v7
- E-commerce Integration: shopify-buy (Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK) / Storefront API
- Icons: Lucide React
- Linting: ESLint

3. ARCHITECTURE & FOLDER STRUCTURE
----------------------------------
The project follows a standard React application structure:

- /src
  - /components: Contains reusable UI elements (e.g., Layout, specific UI parts).
  - /pages: Contains the main page views mapped to routes:
    - Home, Shop, ProductDetails (Browsing)
    - Cart, Wishlist (Shopping Utilities)
    - SignIn, SignUp, Profile, Contact (User & Info)
  - /context: Implements the Context API for global state management:
    - AuthContext: Handles user login/signup state.
    - WishlistContext: Manages user wishlist items.
    - CartContext: (Inferred) Manages shopping cart state.
  - /lib: Contains configuration and helper files, specifically `shopify.js` for initializing the Shopify client.
  - /assets: Static assets.

4. CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
--------------------------------
- **Routing**: Main application routes are defined in `App.jsx`, covering the entire user journey from homepage to checkout preparation.
- **Authentication**: 
  - Login and Signup UI pages exist (`SignIn.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`).
  - `AuthContext.jsx` is currently using a mock implementation and is being prepared for integration with the real Shopify Storefront API.
- **Shopify Configuration**: The `src/lib/shopify.js` file is set up to initialize the Shopify Client using environment variables (`VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`, `VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN`).

5. NEXT STEPS
-------------
- Finalize the integration of Shopify Customer Authentication (Login/Signup) in `AuthContext` and `shopify.js`.
- Ensure session persistence using secure token storage.
- Verify the checkout flow and cart synchronization.
